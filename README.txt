Please search any existing issues for your problem before creating a new one.

I am also looking for input and suggestions for the layout and style of the
application.  If you happen to be a UI guru or have an eye for style and art,
I would be happy to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

You can follow me on twitter (@mkimberlin) for any updates on the current status
of the application.

Be aware that the current version of the application obtains almost all of its
data by scraping the Podiobooks.com site.  As such it is subject to the whims of
the site.  If the site is experiencing difficulty, then the application will as
well.  This also means that we are limited to pulling only the information that
is available on the site.  This is currently only limiting the "Recent Updates"
portion of the application.  The site only shows the last five titles to be
updated.  So days with heavy updates will push some recent update off a bit
prematurely.  I am working with the team that is implementing the new Podiobooks
site design and should be able to overcome these issues once the new site goes
live.

Thanks for your interest in the application and enjoy!
